                    <p>The influence of unpredictability and variety of rewards can be seen in many aspects of a human’s every day life and can drive behaviour towards specific actions. This technique had been deeply studied in the early 50’s and was successfully applied in video games the years that followed, proving that it can also be a great drive of monetization for mobile games or apps if properly embedded in the initial game or app’s design.</p> <p>Back in early 50’s B.F. Skinner used an operant conditioning chamber (known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber" target="_blank"> Skinner Box</a>) to perform experiments and study behaviour conditioning (training) by teaching a subject animal to perform certain actions (like pressing a lever) in response to specific stimuli, such as a light or sound signal in exchange for a reward (food, stop the sound signal etc.). These experiments showed that subject animals that were receiving each time the same reward (for example the exact same food) were initially excited repeating the same action many times, however as time was passing this behaviour was becoming saturated and subject animals would press the leaver to receive food only when hungry. On the other side, subject animals that were receiving a variety of rewards like different size or type of food kept pressing the lever like crazy in the anticipation on what would be the next reward. </p> <p><img src="/images/monetization/rewards1.gif" ></p> <p>If we...

However, moving one step further and adjusting the monetization strategy of the app, based on location and characteristics of the addressed market, can be the “make or break” factor of this app’s performance in its revenue charts!</p> <p>One size does not fit all. We have already discussed this in previous posts. Segmenting the user base of an app and applying different monetization techniques based on the profile of each group can be really rewarding. One of the major groups that can be used and applied in a monetization strategy, is around localisation.</p> <p><b>Dynamic monetization model</b></p> <p>In App Annie and IDC latest <a href="http://go.appannie.com/mobile-app-advertising-and-monetization-trends-2013-2018/" target="_blank">report</a> regarding mobile app revenue composition across iOS App Store and Google Play, we may see that each market reacts differently in mobile revenue models applied.</p> <p><img src="/images/monetization/local2.png"></p> <p>For example, in India, in-app advertising works much better than in-app purchases while in Japan we see the exact opposite. This trend could be happening for several reasons, it could be a cultural thing, a matter of standard of living or even a practical thing like the absence of support for...

                    <p>It is widely accepted, that a very interesting need that thrives among people, is the need of being part of something, even if that thing is not tangible, nor something that users can actually benefit from somehow. Being able to apply such a concept around an app’s design, can leverage several monetization opportunities in the long run.</p> <p><img src="/images/monetization/team.png"></p> <p><b>Build up a story</b></p> <p>A good story built around an app, can bring excitement and engagement to the users. This story could be anything like solving an unsolvable problem, rescuing a princess, killing the bad guy, or even just creating a better content in a news or quiz app. Users that engage in such a story, can become loyal and addicted, and this can be a good opportunity for publishers in order to apply techniques discussed in previous articles. A good narration script describing a story during the on-boarding experience can be an example of this strategy. Users trying to follow that story, can be confronted later on with several scarcity monetization moments.</p> <p><b>Align users with a bigger cause or vision</b></p> <p>People tend to believe in a bigger cause or vision...or at least can easily get aligned with one.

After all, these users ended up using the same app for a reason. Converting this user base to an active community is a big challenge. App publishers should try, when designing their apps, to make them as social as possible. Initially they should focus towards growing their user base and creating a community around their app by leveraging a social environment. Users need a relevant audience to discuss and expose achievements or progress. Building a community around the app and allowing interaction between its members, brings engagement to the users, rise competitiveness and if exposed properly, can drive awareness about the app and bring virality and wider adoption.</p> <p><b>Implement the right social components</b></p> <p>While designing an app, publishers should choose the right social components to integrate based on the context of their app and their app’s userbase profile.

Today we are going deeper around scarcity and we will discuss upon monetizing around user impatience.</p> <p>Periods of scarcity during an app’s lifecycle can reveal several monetization opportunities and drive irrational user behaviour, converting a user to an obsessive payer. Scarcity in terms of time usually drives user impatience. Therefore it has become a common practise nowadays especially in games and other social apps to see short or long periods of time of what we will call here “Moments of Silence” where users are prevented from keep using the app or are excluded from certain features. This strategy is driving one thing; obsession and is pointing upon raising user impatience.</p> <p><img src="/images/monetization/social1.png"></p> <p>If a user is able to play or use an app in an abundance environment, this drives users to play until one specific point and then stop and forget about the app. But when a user after a while, when being engaged with the app, a sudden Moment of Silence happens, that user starts thinking about the app, and when will time pass in order to be able to continue using the app. In the meantime that user becomes obsessed about not being allowed to to continue using the app, thinking about this all the time and coming back...
