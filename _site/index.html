These experiments showed that subject animals that were receiving each time the same reward (for example the exact same food) were initially excited repeating the same action many times, however as time was passing this behaviour was becoming saturated and subject animals would press the leaver to receive food only when hungry. On the other side, subject animals that were receiving a variety of rewards like different size or type of food kept pressing the lever like crazy in the anticipation on what would be the next reward.</p> <p><img src="/images/monetization/skinner.jpg" /></p> <p>If we study...

                    <p>It is widely accepted, that a very interesting need that thrives among people, is the need of being part of something, even if that thing is not tangible, nor something that users can actually benefit from somehow. Being able to apply such a concept around an app’s design, can leverage several monetization opportunities in the long run.</p> <p><img src="/images/monetization/team.png" /></p> <p><b>Build up a story</b></p> <p>A good story built around an app, can bring excitement and engagement to the users. This story could be anything like solving an unsolvable problem, rescuing a princess, killing the bad guy, or even just creating a better content in a news or quiz app. Users that engage in such a story, can become loyal and addicted, and this can be a good opportunity for publishers in order to apply techniques discussed in previous articles. A good narration script describing a story during the on-boarding experience can be an example of this strategy. Users trying to follow that story, can be confronted later on with several scarcity monetization moments.</p> <p><b>Align users with a bigger cause or vision</b></p> <p>People tend to believe in a bigger cause or vision…or at least can easily get aligned with one. We could initiate this discussion from religion but we do not have to go that deep. In the past, several techniques were used by publishers either on the web or mobile,...
