                    <p>The influence of unpredictability and variety of rewards can be seen in many aspects of a human’s every day life and can drive behaviour towards specific actions. This technique had been deeply studied in the early 50’s and was successfully applied in video games the years that followed, proving that it can also be a great drive of monetization for mobile games or apps if properly embedded in the initial game or app’s design.</p> <p>Back in early 50’s B.F. Skinner used an operant conditioning chamber (known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber" target="_blank"> Skinner Box</a>) to perform experiments and study behaviour conditioning (training) by teaching a subject animal to perform certain actions (like pressing a lever) in response to specific stimuli, such as a light or sound signal in exchange for a reward (food, stop the sound signal etc.). These experiments showed that subject animals that were receiving each time the same reward (for example the exact same food) were initially excited repeating the same action many times, however as time was passing this behaviour was becoming saturated and subject animals would press...

After all, these users ended up using the same app for a reason. Converting this user base to an active community is a big challenge. App publishers should try, when designing their apps, to make them as social as possible. Initially they should focus towards growing their user base and creating a community around their app by leveraging a social environment. Users need a relevant audience to discuss and expose achievements or progress. Building a community around the app and allowing interaction between its members, brings engagement to the...

Scarcity in terms of time usually drives user impatience. Therefore it has become a common practise nowadays especially in games and other social apps to see short or long periods of time of what we will call here “Moments of Silence” where users are prevented from keep using the app or are excluded from certain features. This strategy is driving one thing; obsession and is pointing upon raising user impatience.</p> <p><img src="/images/monetization/social1.png"></p> <p>If a user is able to play or use an app in an abundance environment, this drives users to play until one specific point and then stop and forget about the app. But when a user after a while, when being engaged with the app, a sudden Moment of...

Abundance is usually not appreciated by anyone and does not motivate a user. Creating short times of abundance within a scarcity period, can be quite appealing and challenging for a user, creating several monetization opportunities in the way.
