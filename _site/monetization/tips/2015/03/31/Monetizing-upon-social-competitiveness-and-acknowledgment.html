        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Following up the latest blog posts about monetizing around user feelings, today we are going to discuss about monetizing around social behaviour.</p>

<p>Every mobile app needs a loyal user base in order to be able to generate some serious money for its owner. One of the most difficult things out there is to attract users to the app and engage them, so that eventually later on, will spent some money within the app.</p>

<p><img src="/images/monetization/social4.png"></p>

<p><b>Build a community fist </b></p>

<p>Every app has a user base, that shares some common interests. After all, these users ended up using the same app for a reason. Converting this user base to an active community is a big challenge. App publishers should try, when designing their apps, to make them as social as possible. Initially they should focus towards growing their user base and creating a community around their app by leveraging a social environment. Users need a relevant audience to discuss and expose achievements or progress. Building a community around the app and allowing interaction between its members, brings engagement to the users, rise competitiveness and if exposed properly, can drive awareness about the app and bring virality and wider adoption.</p>

<p><b>Implement the right social components</b></p>

<p>While designing an app, publishers should choose the right social components to integrate based on the context of their app and their appâ€™s userbase profile. Leveraging social behaviour through an app can attract users to come and use an app again and again for all kind of different reasons. Some of them would like to use it in order to compete with others for social acknowledgement and exposure; and others because they just want to be part of a social environment. Social components can be anything, from progress bars, badges, leaderboards, achievements, to virtual goods. Integrating these components and mechanisms properly within an app can raise community engagement, collaboration and competitiveness, increasing this way loyalty and adoption of the app.</p>

<p><b>Monetize upon social competitiveness and acknowledgement</b></p>

<p>When an app publisher has successfully integrated social characteristics and components in the app, and a loyal user base exists, monetization opportunities can be revealed where users, in the shake of feelings like social competitiveness and acknowledgement, are willing to spend money within the app. These opportunities may be in the form of in-app purchases for unlocking a stage and letting the user proceed, or gaining virtual goodies that will bring an advantage to the user against others, or even taking specific advertising tasks in order to help proceed further for example and get socially exposed.</p>

<p>To conclude, app publishers should consider making their app as much social as possible by exposing several social characteristics and build a community around them. Engagement and retention that will follow through these social aspects of the app will reveal later on, opportunities to monetize upon social feelings like competitiveness and acknowledgement, that will thrive.</p>
