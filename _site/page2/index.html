                    In our last article we discussed about monetizing upon user feelings and in particular around scarcity, uniqueness and exclusiveness. Today we are going deeper around scarcity and we will discuss upon monetizing around user impatience. Periods of scarcity during an app’s lifecycle can reveal several monetization opportunities and drive irrational user behaviour, converting a user to an obsessive payer. Scarcity in terms of time usually drives user impatience. Therefore it has become a common practise nowadays especially in games and other social apps to see short or long periods of time of what we will call here “Moments of Silence” where users are prevented from keep using the app or are excluded from certain features. This strategy is driving one thing; obsession and is pointing upon raising user impatience. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/monetization/social1.png"> If a user is able to play or use an app in an abundance environment, this drives users to play until one specific point and then stop and forget about the app. But when a user after a while, when being engaged with the app, a sudden Moment of Silence happens, that user starts thinking about the app, and when will time pass in order to be able to continue using the app. In the meantime that user becomes obsessed about not being allowed to to continue using the app, thinking about this all the time and coming back again and again to check if he is able to continue. During this obsession time, a monetization opportunity is available and that is the right time to provide...

                    There are a lot of things app developers can monetize around an app user but nothing compares with monetizing upon user feelings. Designing an app to work in an abundance environment is usually a wrong strategic approach in terms of monetization. Abundance is usually not appreciated by anyone and does not motivate a user. Creating short times of abundance within a scarcity period, can be quite appealing and challenging for a user, creating several monetization opportunities in the way. An app user that is in position to have everything he needs whenever he needs it within an app, is quite difficult to be monetized. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/monetization/scarcity.png"> Moreover, if an app is designed in a way that the user feels some sort of uniqueness while making progress within the app, or he is offered the option to has access to something exclusive, this can end up to very good conversions monetization wise. <b>Scarcity</b> An app developer should control scarcity when designing an app in way that users are always able to achieve a goal which is difficult (or has a price) but always feasible. If a user does not have all features available at once or does not have unlimited ammo, or unlimited weapons οr lives within a game for example, that user will appreciate more the opportunity to renew, expand or reveal resources through monetization moments either through IAP or by completing specific tasks like watching a video, clicking an ad or completing a survey. Trying to monetize an app user who lives in abundance within the app,...

                    Planning a monetization strategy upfront, is a key point towards an app’s monetization success. Including in this strategy a proper handling of user’s first experience, during the on-boarding process of the app, is quite important. Getting an app visible and being downloaded many times is the first goal in the app store battle. App publishers can achieve that either through proper ASO or a well designed marketing plan or any other way. Keeping users engaged with the app, after downloading it, is the next achievement to be accomplished and therefore the on-boarding experience is very crucial. After all, you get a first experience only once! It is widely known that most of the users abandon an app early on, and in particular, the first time that they try to use it. Several developers ignore this fact and usually do not separate, nor consider the on-boarding experience in their monetization strategy. Through Pollfish network we have seen several examples and bad practises that affect first user experience. One of them, is overflowing users with ads in different parts of the app even before users are familiar with what the app can do and what it can offer, resulting to frustrated users leaving the app. App publishers should not try to monetize their app too soon. Applying monetization techniques too early can affect retention. User first experience should be treated wisely and without the goal on an ephemeral revenue but focusing on increasing LTV for each user in the long run. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/monetization/first_exp.png"> An appropriate plan for the on-boarding process...

                    This is the start of a series of articles regarding creating and using overlays on Android. An overlay is a view that is placed above other views. Such views can be created on Android with several different ways and for different purposes. There are several usages for overlays on Android. Some of them include: <ol> <li>Floating buttons/menus</li> <li>Onboarding tutorials</li> <li>Advertising</li> <li>Augmented Reality</li> <li>Fancy animations</li> </ol> <h2>Life under WindowManager</h2> In this article we will see how we can create an overlay view that will lie on top of other applications with the help of WindowManager. But let's see first what is a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.html" target="_blank">WindowManager.</a> WindowManager is a system service responsible for organizing the screen. It interacts with applications to create windows and decides where they will go on the screen and in which order. When creating a window, WindowManager requests a Surface for that window and on that Surface, an application will draw its user interface. Each window is a container of views and has its own view hierarchy. <u>But let's be more specific and list what a WindowManager is and what it does:</u> <ul> <li>A system service </li> <li>It requests the creation and allocation of surfaces for the clients (applications)</li> <li>Is responsible of which windows are visible, their z-order and how they are laid on the screen </li> <li>It deals and dispatches input and focus events to clients </li>...

                    The influence of unpredictability and variety of rewards can be seen in many aspects of a human’s every day life and can drive behaviour towards specific actions. This technique had been deeply studied in the early 50’s and was successfully applied in video games the years that followed, proving that it can also be a great drive of monetization for mobile games or apps if properly embedded in the initial game or app’s design. Back in early 50’s B.F. Skinner used an operant conditioning chamber (known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber" target="_blank"> Skinner Box</a>) to perform experiments and study behaviour conditioning (training) by teaching a subject animal to perform certain actions (like pressing a lever) in response to specific stimuli, such as a light or sound signal in exchange for a reward (food, stop the sound signal etc.). These experiments showed that subject animals that were receiving each time the same reward (for example the exact same food) were initially excited repeating the same action many times, however as time was passing this behaviour was becoming saturated and subject animals would press the leaver to receive food only when hungry. On the other side, subject animals that were receiving a variety of rewards like different size or type of food kept pressing the lever like crazy in the anticipation on what would be the next reward. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/monetization/rewards1.gif" > If...

                    In this blog post we will discuss about adjusting an app’s monetization strategy based on the location and market profile of its user base. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/monetization/local1.png"> Considering to localize an app’s content when deciding to expand to different markets it’s a key point to its success and adoption. However, moving one step further and adjusting the monetization strategy of the app, based on location and characteristics of the addressed market, can be the “make or break” factor of this app’s performance in its revenue charts! One size does not fit all. We have already discussed this in previous posts. Segmenting the user base of an app and applying different monetization techniques based on the profile of each group can be really rewarding. One of the major groups that can be used and applied in a monetization strategy, is around localisation. <b>Dynamic monetization model</b> In App Annie and IDC latest <a href="http://go.appannie.com/mobile-app-advertising-and-monetization-trends-2013-2018/" target="_blank">report</a> regarding mobile app revenue composition across iOS App Store and Google Play, we may see that each market reacts differently in mobile revenue models applied. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/monetization/local2.png"> For example, in India, in-app advertising works much better than in-app purchases while in Japan we see the exact opposite.

                    It is widely accepted, that a very interesting need that thrives among people, is the need of being part of something, even if that thing is not tangible, nor something that users can actually benefit from somehow. Being able to apply such a concept around an app’s design, can leverage several monetization opportunities in the long run. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/monetization/team.png"> <b>Build up a story</b> A good story built around an app, can bring excitement and engagement to the users. This story could be anything like solving an unsolvable problem, rescuing a princess, killing the bad guy, or even just creating a better content in a news or quiz app. Users that engage in such a story, can become loyal and addicted, and this can be a good opportunity for publishers in order to apply techniques discussed in previous articles. A good narration script describing a story during the on-boarding experience can be an example of this strategy. Users trying to follow that story, can be confronted later on with several scarcity monetization moments. <b>Align users with a bigger cause or vision</b> People tend to believe in a bigger cause or vision...or at least can easily get aligned with one. We could initiate this discussion from religion but we do not have to go that deep. In the past, several techniques were used by publishers either on the web or...
