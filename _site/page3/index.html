Today we are going deeper around scarcity and we will discuss upon monetizing around user impatience.</p> <p>Periods of scarcity during an app’s lifecycle can reveal several monetization opportunities and drive irrational user behaviour, converting a user to an obsessive payer. Scarcity in terms of time usually drives user impatience. Therefore it has become a common practise nowadays especially in games and other social apps to see short or long periods of time of what we will call here “Moments of Silence”...

Abundance is usually not appreciated by anyone and does not motivate a user. Creating short times of abundance within a scarcity period, can be quite appealing and challenging for a user, creating several monetization opportunities in the way.

App publishers can achieve that either through proper ASO or a well designed marketing plan or any other way.

                    <p>Following up the series of previous articles on how to create overlays on Android we will study in this post how to add an overlay over an Activity. We will do that by traversing it’s current view hierarchy and injecting directly a RelativeLayout below window’s DecorView. This RelativeLayout will hold the overlay layout, along with the original layout of the Activity that is already in place.</p> <h3>The Basics</h3> <p>A simple way to add an overlay to a layout is to have a FrameLayout or a RelativeLayout as a parent, and then place the overlay view as a new child in the appropriate z-order in order to be on top of the current layout. Both FrameLayout and RelativeLayout can support this approach. FrameLayout is designed to hold a stack of child views with the most recent placed on top while RelativeLayout can be used to position child views either relative to each other, or to the screen boundaries. If two or more child views are relative to the same thing, they are placed in a stack structure with the most recent on top, similar to FrameLayout approach.</p> <p>The exact same concept is followed by Android framework with DecorView (which is a FrameLayout) and the child view marked with id/content (which is also a FrameLayout) that usually holds the view hierarchy of the content of the Activity.</p> <p>Now let’s see a quick...

                    <p><img src="/images/monetization/google_vest.png" /></p> <p>As apps’ visibility becomes more and more difficult, app developers are working hard to make their apps stand out among thousands of new apps appearing every day. There is a big variety of articles out there on how to increase an app’s discoverability through ASO techniques, marketing campaigns and others. What is most important, though? Spend on ad marketing campaigns? Creating press releases, or dive into Google Play mechanisms to understand and position better an app on store? Anyone could argue that app developers should be doing all of that anyway…this is so true, but where should be their main focus?</p> <p>By using a <a href="http://www.pollfish.com" target="_blank">Pollfish</a>, a tool that allows direct interaction and gathering of feedback from thousands of mobile app users instantly, the main challenge was to find and ask the right questions: How do you discover apps that you download? What are the most important things that you check before downloading an app?</p> <p>In order to get an idea of possible answers from users, two surveys were initially crafted (<a href="https://www.pollfish.com/dashboard/results/7967/936952752" target="_blank">survey1</a>, <a href="https://www.pollfish.com/dashboard/results/7991/450930325" target="_blank">survey2</a>) and launched where users were able to enter their opinion on several open-ended questions around mobile apps. Answers from those two surveys were used later on, to create a bigger <a href="https://www.pollfish.com/dashboard/results/8002/36472338" target="_blank">survey</a> that went live at the beginning of March and got distributed to more than 3,000 Android...

PhoneWindow is responsible for holding the activity’s view hierarchy.

                    <p>The influence of unpredictability and variety of rewards can be seen in many aspects of a human’s every day life and can drive behaviour towards specific actions. This technique had been deeply studied in the early 50’s and was successfully applied in video games the years that followed, proving that it can also be a great drive of monetization for mobile games or apps if properly embedded in the initial game or app’s design.</p> <p>Back in early 50’s B.F. Skinner used an operant conditioning chamber (known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber" target="_blank"> Skinner Box</a>) to perform experiments and study behaviour conditioning (training) by teaching a subject animal to perform certain actions (like pressing a lever) in response to specific stimuli, such as a light or sound signal in exchange for a reward (food, stop the sound signal etc.). These experiments showed that subject animals that were receiving each time the same reward (for example the exact same food) were initially excited repeating the same action many times, however as time was passing this behaviour was becoming saturated and subject animals would press the leaver to receive food only when hungry. On the other side, subject animals that were receiving a variety of rewards like different size or type of food kept pressing the lever like crazy in the anticipation on what would be the next reward.</p> <p><img src="/images/monetization/skinner.jpg" /></p> <p>If we study...
