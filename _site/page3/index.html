                    <p>Are app users abandoning the classic buy/sell concept of paid model? Are paid apps on life support? Why do most top titles on app stores, follow the freemium rather than the paid model?</p> <p><img src="/images/monetization/paid_apps.png"></p> <p>Paid apps have been one of the most popular and traditional approaches since the first rise of app stores. This model has thrived for years especially on stores like AppStore where users were more willing to pay for apps. However, for years, app developers had the feeling that users would pay for apps like they were doing for desktop, nintendo, psp game titles and other consoles. That concept faded out through the years.</p> <p>Developers devote a lot of time on the development, design and marketing of an app and they believe that this effort should be rewarded straight away. Unfortunately this is not how the system works. At least not any more for most of the cases.</p> <p>When developers choose to go with the paid option approach, many things should be taken under consideration. Higher pricing does not mean higher revenue. Visibility on store and users purchase intent are not granted, nor easily achieved. Yes, of course if 100 thousand people download an app and the developer sells it for $2.99 he can be rich. Unfortunately in real life this is wishful thinking..or a misconception on how the ecosystem works. Gaining attention on the app stores and seeing a paid app in the top grossing category is more than a painful road nowadays.</p> <p>Asking users to pay upfront for an app means that users will...

During the last two years and through our daily interaction with developers and the apps’ ecosystem we have seen a lot including several mistakes, bad and good practises and strategies .</p> <p>Our main aim is to provide a better and deeper understanding to the app developer community, on different monetization techniques that exist out there and help developers adjust and evolve within the current mobile monetization landscape in a way that will increase their apps’ revenue.</p> <p><b>The two types of mobile app users</b></p> <p><img src="/images/monetization/two_users.png"></p> <p>One of the key factors when trying to understand mobile monetization landscape is the acknowledgement that there are two types of mobile app users out there:</p> <ol> <li><b>App users that are willing to pay (even 1 cent)</b> - These users have no concerns on using their credit card or any other type of payment during an app’s lifecycle or even upfront. Developers can capitalize upon these users with different models like paid apps, in-app purchases, subscriptions and other. Understanding which of those models performs better in the context of a specific app will affect eventually the conversions achieved. </li> <li><b>App users that are not willing to pay (anything ever)</b> - Some users will never pay for anything relevant to apps in general, or specifically for an app. </li> </ol> <p>Within an app’s user base it...

It interacts with applications to create windows and decides where they will go on the screen and in which order. When creating a window, WindowManager requests a Surface for that window and on that Surface, an application will draw its user interface. Each window is a container of views and has its own view hierarchy.</p> <p><u>But let&#39;s be more specific and list what a WindowManager is and what it does:</u> <ul> <li>A system service </li> <li>It requests the creation and allocation of surfaces for the clients (applications)</li> <li>Is responsible of which windows are visible, their z-order and how they are laid on the screen </li> <li>It deals and dispatches input and focus events to clients </li>...

                    <p>The influence of unpredictability and variety of rewards can be seen in many aspects of a human’s every day life and can drive behaviour towards specific actions. This technique had been deeply studied in the early 50’s and was successfully applied in video games the years that followed, proving that it can also be a great drive of monetization for mobile games or apps if properly embedded in the initial game or app’s design.</p> <p>Back in early 50’s B.F. Skinner used an operant conditioning chamber (known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber" target="_blank"> Skinner Box</a>) to perform experiments and study behaviour conditioning (training) by teaching a subject animal to perform certain actions (like pressing a lever) in response to specific stimuli, such as a light or sound signal in exchange for a reward (food, stop the sound signal etc.). These experiments showed that subject animals that were receiving each time the same reward (for example the exact same food) were initially excited repeating the same action many times, however as time was passing this behaviour was becoming saturated and subject animals would press the leaver to receive food only when hungry. On the other side, subject animals that were receiving a variety of rewards like different size or type of food kept pressing the lever like crazy in the anticipation on what would be the next reward. </p> <p><img src="/images/monetization/skinner.jpg" ></p> <p>If we...

However, moving one step further and adjusting the monetization strategy of the app, based on location and characteristics of the addressed market, can be the “make or break” factor of this app’s performance in its revenue charts!</p> <p>One size does not fit all. We have already discussed this in previous posts. Segmenting the user base of an app and applying different monetization techniques based on the profile of each group can be really rewarding. One of the major groups that can be used and applied in a monetization strategy, is around localisation.</p> <p><b>Dynamic monetization model</b></p> <p>In App Annie and IDC latest <a href="http://go.appannie.com/mobile-app-advertising-and-monetization-trends-2013-2018/" target="_blank">report</a> regarding mobile app revenue composition across iOS App Store and Google Play, we may see that each market reacts differently in mobile revenue models applied.</p> <p><img src="/images/monetization/local2.png"></p> <p>For example, in India, in-app advertising works much better than in-app purchases while in Japan we see the exact opposite.

                    <p>It is widely accepted, that a very interesting need that thrives among people, is the need of being part of something, even if that thing is not tangible, nor something that users can actually benefit from somehow.

This story could be anything like solving an unsolvable problem, rescuing a princess, killing the bad guy, or even just creating a better content in a news or quiz app. Users that engage in such a story, can become loyal and addicted, and this can be a good opportunity for publishers in order to apply techniques discussed in previous articles. A good narration script describing a story during the on-boarding experience can be an example of this strategy. Users trying to follow that story, can be confronted later on with several scarcity monetization moments.</p> <p><b>Align users with a bigger cause or vision</b></p> <p>People tend to believe in a bigger cause or vision...or at least can easily get aligned with one.

                    <p>Following up the latest blog posts about monetizing around user feelings, today we are going to discuss about monetizing around social behaviour.</p> <p>Every mobile app needs a loyal user base in order to be able to generate some serious money for its owner. One of the most difficult things out there is to attract users to the app and engage them, so that eventually later on, will spent some money within the app.</p> <p><img src="/images/monetization/social4.png"></p> <p><b>Build a community fist </b></p> <p>Every app has a user base, that shares some common interests. After all, these users ended up using the same app for a reason. Converting this user base to an active community is a big challenge. App publishers should try, when designing their apps, to make them as social as possible. Initially they should focus towards growing their user base and creating a community around their app by leveraging a social environment. Users need a relevant audience to discuss and expose achievements or progress. Building a community around the app and allowing interaction between its members, brings engagement to the users, rise competitiveness and if exposed properly, can drive awareness about the app and bring virality and wider adoption.</p> <p><b>Implement the right social components</b></p> <p>While designing an app, publishers should choose the right social components to integrate based on the context of their app and their app’s userbase profile.
