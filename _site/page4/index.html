                    There are a lot of things app developers can monetize around an app user but nothing compares with monetizing upon user feelings. Designing an app to work in an abundance environment is usually a wrong strategic approach in terms of monetization. Abundance is usually not appreciated by anyone and does not motivate a user. Creating short times of abundance within a scarcity period, can be quite appealing and challenging for a user, creating several monetization opportunities in the way. An app user that is in position to have everything he needs whenever he needs it within an app, is quite...

                    Planning a monetization strategy upfront, is a key point towards an app’s monetization success. Including in this strategy a proper handling of user’s first experience, during the on-boarding process of the app, is quite important. Getting an app visible and being downloaded many times is the first goal in the app store battle. App publishers can achieve that either through proper ASO or a well designed marketing plan or any other way. Keeping users engaged with the app, after downloading it, is the next achievement to be accomplished and therefore the on-boarding experience is very crucial. After all, you get...

                <section class="post-content">
                    When creating our own iOS framework, after the release of XCode 7 we needed to start supporting bitcode. For those not familiar with bitcode, bitcode is an intermediate representation of a compiled program and is part of the App Thinning feature introduced in XCode 7. With Bitcode, apps can be re-optimized for each device before being delivered to a user. You can read more on this on Apple docs <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/tvos/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AppThinning/AppThinning.html" target="_blank">here.</a> <h3>The problem</h3> You can easily build an iOS library with bitcode support. In order to achieve that you just need to go to <b>Build settings</b>, search for <b>"custom compiler flags"</b> and add <b>-fembed-bitcode</b>. This flag informs XCode to build the library with bitcode and everything works fine under XCode 7. However by following the approach above we loose backwards compatibility with XCode 6. Having that said we need to ship 2 different library versions, one with bitcode flag and one without, since not everyone in our developers' community upgraded to XCode 7. <h3>The solution</h3> In order to be able to provide a single framework that would support both bitcode enabled or not apps, we needed to create a fat library that would include both configurations. We build therefore our configurations with xcodebuild both with ENABLE_BITCODE=NO and ENABLE_BITCODE=YES as shown below: ``` xcodebuild -configuration "Release" ENABLE_BITCODE=NO -target "${FMK_NAME}" -sdK iphoneos xcodebuild -configuration "Release" ENABLE_BITCODE=NO -target "${FMK_NAME}" -sdk iphonesimulator xcodebuild...

                    When deciding to create a library that will be distributed publicly among the developer ecosystem you need to consider in which format you will expose it to the community. <br/> <h3>Initial considerations</h3> There are several things that affect this decision and there are several formats to choose from. Does your library need to include Android resources to perform, is this an open or a closed source project? What is your major target audience, what are the main tools this audience uses and which format are they more familiar with? Where will you host this library and many other factors should be taken under consideration. <h3>Major formats</h3> Currently, there are four major formats out there: <ul> <li><b>1) Library module - </b> <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/index.html#LibraryProjects" target="_blank">Library modules</a> contain shareable source code and resources. Developers can reference them in their Android projects and, at build time, include its compiled sources in their apks. Library modules have a structure similar to Android projects but cannot include raw assets. Distributing a library this way, requires providing source code publicly available and maintaining it among the community with any implications this might have </li> <li><b>2) JAR - </b> Jar files are used widely among the Android and Java community in general. It is a Java archive format that contains all classes of the library (*class files). The contents of a jar file can be extracted easily with...

                    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/monetization/surv.jpg" > Mobile monetization is one of the key issues app developers face in today’s mobile world. As apps’ visibility become more and more hard, developers are looking for new effective ways to monetize their apps through different monetization strategies. One of the most widely used strategies is monetization through ads and as Steve Jobs said once, “Mobile Ads suck”. Unfortunately this is <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/245690/yep-mobile-ads-suck-coke-kraft-papa-johns-kn.html" target="_blank">widely accepted</a> by big brands as true. Different ad platforms are suggesting several units such as banner ads, interstitials, video ads, offer walls and others. Developers are usually confused on what ad units to use or from which ad platform, but what they really care at the end of the day is to make money out of their app without loosing their users by compromising user experience. As seen in a <a href="https://www.pollfish.com/infographic/developer" target="_blank">survey</a> of 5,000 mobile users by <a href="https://www.pollfish.com" target="_blank">Pollfish</a>, people are generally annoyed by the current different ad formats that overwhelm an apps’ user interface, sometimes placed in a way to force users to click on them. Most of current ad units engage user with the ad taking him away from the app rather than keeping him engaged with the content of the app. The market would be served well by a new interactive monetization format that can revolutionise the way mobile developers make money out of apps at...

                    Following up the series of previous articles on how to create overlays on Android we will study in this post how to add an overlay over an Activity. We will do that by traversing it’s current view hierarchy and injecting directly a RelativeLayout below window’s DecorView. This RelativeLayout will hold the overlay layout, along with the original layout of the Activity that is already in place. <h3>The Basics</h3> A simple way to add an overlay to a layout is to have a FrameLayout or a RelativeLayout as a parent, and then place the overlay view as a new child in the appropriate z-order in order to be on top of the current layout. Both FrameLayout and RelativeLayout can support this approach. FrameLayout is designed to hold a stack of child views with the most recent placed on top while RelativeLayout can be used to position child views either relative to each other, or to the screen boundaries. If two or more child views are relative to the same thing, they are placed in a stack structure with the most recent on top, similar to FrameLayout approach. The exact same concept is followed by Android framework with DecorView (which is a FrameLayout) and the child view marked with id/content (which is also a FrameLayout) that usually holds the view hierarchy of the content of the Activity. Now let’s see a quick...

There is a big variety of articles out there on how to increase an app’s discoverability through ASO techniques, marketing campaigns and others. What is most important, though? Spend on ad marketing campaigns? Creating press releases, or dive into Google Play mechanisms to understand and position better an app on store? Anyone could argue that app developers should be doing all of that anyway…this is so true, but where should be their main focus? By using a <a href="http://www.pollfish.com" target="_blank">Pollfish</a>, a tool that allows direct interaction and gathering of feedback from thousands of mobile app users instantly, the main challenge was to find and ask the right questions: How do you discover apps that you download? What are the most important things that you check before downloading an app? In order to get an idea of possible answers from users, two surveys were initially crafted (<a href="https://www.pollfish.com/dashboard/results/7967/936952752" target="_blank">survey1</a>, <a href="https://www.pollfish.com/dashboard/results/7991/450930325" target="_blank">survey2</a>) and launched where users were able to enter their opinion on several open-ended questions around mobile apps. Answers from those two surveys were used later on, to create a bigger <a href="https://www.pollfish.com/dashboard/results/8002/36472338" target="_blank">survey</a> that went live at the beginning of March and got distributed to more than 3,000...
